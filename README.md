# Todo-List-project


This project is a web application for managing to-do lists, developed using the Django framework.

The main goal of the application is to assist users in organizing and managing their tasks. Users can create new tasks, set deadlines for them, mark them as completed or incomplete, and assign tags to them for easier classification.
